P-Wine is a compatibility layer that allows users to run Windows applications on non-Windows operating systems — just like Wine on Linux. It translates Windows API calls into native system calls, enabling seamless execution of Windows software without requiring a full Windows installation or virtual machine. P-Wine is designed to replicate Wine’s functionality, offering the same core features and compatibility for running Windows programs outside of Windows.
