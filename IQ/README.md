If I were you, I would use the [PP-Terminal](https://github.com/Peharge/p-terminal) and run the `IQ` command, if I were you ;-)

If you don't know how to clone this repo,
you probably shouldn't use this terminal!

If you cloned it:
Run pp-term\run-pp-term.bat on your Windows PC â€“
and you're good to go.
